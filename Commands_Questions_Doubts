****** Uninstall old versions ******
    Older versions of Docker went by docker or docker-engine. Uninstall any such older
    versions before attempting to install a new version, along with associated dependencies.
Ans: sudo dnf remove docker \
      docker-client \
      docker-client-latest \
      docker-common \
      docker-latest \
      docker-latest-logrotate \
      docker-logrotate \
      docker-selinux \
      docker-engine-selinux \ 
      docker-engine




*****   what is the use of -p 50000:50000 is in docker run command? *******
In a Docker run command, the -p option is used to map ports between the Docker container and the host machine. The syntax for the -p option is -p hostPort:containerPort.
In the specific case you mentioned, -p 50000:50000 means that you are mapping port 50000 from the host machine to port 50000 inside the Docker container.
For example:   docker run -p 50000:50000 <image_name>
Here's what this does:

hostPort: This is the port on your host machine. In this case, it's 50000.
containerPort: This is the port inside the Docker container. Again, it's 50000 in this example.
This port mapping is commonly used in scenarios where a service inside the Docker container is running on a specific port, and you want to make it accessible from the host machine.

In the context of Jenkins (as you've mentioned port 50000), this is often used for Jenkins agent connections. Jenkins agents can connect 
to the Jenkins master using the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) on port 50000, and by specifying this port mapping, you're making sure 
that the host machine can receive connections on port 50000 and forward them to the same port inside the Docker container where Jenkins is listening for agent connections.
